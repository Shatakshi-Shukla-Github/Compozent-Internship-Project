# Compozent-Internship-Project
 A Restaurant's Website:- Taste'sHub is a Restaurant's website which will enable the user to search the menu of the restaurant, to study the category of the food served, the price of each dishes and in case of any query the user can contact the hotel management through a message. These all facilities are provided to the user through a user-friendly interface. This project has around 54% CSS, 43% HTML, and a very small amount of JavaScript i.e. around 3%. Our aim is to make a user-friendly website that makes every tedious task done in a very simple manner!
